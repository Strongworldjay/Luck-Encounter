# Luck Encounter Project
## Overview
Luck Encounter Project is a fantasy-themed web application that provides a structured item database organized by type and rarity. Itâ€™s built with React and leverages modern libraries like react-router-dom for client-side routing and axios for API requests. The project includes an itemdata.js file that holds detailed lists of various items (e.g., Robe, Breastplate, Half Plate) organized by rarity, making it easy to manage and extend.

## Features

- Client-Side Routing: Navigate seamlessly through different sections of the app with react-router-dom.
- HTTP Requests: Handle API calls and data fetching with axios.
- Modular Structure: Easily extendable codebase with clear separation of concerns.
